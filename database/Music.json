It is only the beginning of a wild interdimensional goose-chase that places Mimu in the position to save the world, if only she can believe in herself.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/2736.webp"},{"title":"Show By Rock!! x Joysound","synopsis":"A series of cross-promotional shorts with Joysound featuring Show By Rock characters.","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/81513.webp"},{"title":"Boku wa Sonzai Shiteinakatta","synopsis":"Music video included with the first single of the digital idol group 22/7 (Nanabun no Nijuuni).","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/87429.webp"},{"title":"Yumeyume","synopsis":"Music video from DECO*27.\n\n\"Miku Hatsune and Future Stars Project mirai\" (SEGA) Main Theme Song","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/35615.webp"},{"title":"◯","synopsis":"Sawako Kabuki hand-drawn animation.","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/76372.webp"},{"title":"Daybreak Interlude","synopsis":"Official music video for TRIGGER's song DAYBREAK INTERLUDE also released on their \"REGALITY\" album.

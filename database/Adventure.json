The Symphonic Poem originated with the music Isao Tomita wrote for Jungle Emperor in 1965. He re-worked his music into a long form which tells a story by itself. (This form of music was termed \"symphonic poem\" or \"tone poem\" by composers in the late Romantic era.) So music that was written originally to enhance visual story telling became the story teller.\n\nTomita's symphonic poem was recorded in the mid-60s and issued on LP in Japan. More than once, in fact. It has also been on CD more than once.\n\nIn 1991, Tezuka Productions turned the process upside down and created new animation to illustrate the symphonic poem. The story is basically that of the first Kimba episode. We see the peaceful animal kingdom under Panja, the coming of the hunters, Eliza's capture and Panja's death. Kimba is born and escapes back to Africa. All this told without a single word spoken. The style of the Symphonic Poem's animation is unique. It draws heavily on the style of the 1989 TV series, but Kimba looks different from the way he looked in any other production.\n\n(Source: kimbawlion.com)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/36639.webp","source":"-","numberOfEpisode":"1","studio":"Madhouse","type":"OVA","score":6.5,"genres":["Adventure","Kids","Shounen"]},{"title":"Cool Cool Bye","synopsis":"Two brothers are riding around on their hover bikes, when suddenly a giant metal fortress gets in their way.

Pinocchio (Mokku) is characterized as having many character faults which he must learn to overcome in order to be worthy of being granted humanity. Some of these character faults include selfishness, rudeness, insensitivity, indolence, obstinacy, over- trusting, self-pity, stupidity, disobedience, compulsive lying, arrogance, greed, cowardice, recklessness, cruelty, foolishness and an inability to learn from mistakes.\n\nThroughout the entire series Pinocchio (Mokku), partly due to his own delinquency and repetitive disobedience, must undergo other costly ordeals of hardship and pain in which he is continuously tormented, persecuted, bullied, humiliated, tricked, ridiculed, ostracised, beaten, downtrodden and subjected to degrading and inhumane treatment. Its plain depiction of the austere reality of what it would be like to be literally subhuman growing up in a world of danger and hardship, makes this another good example of traditional Japanese stories, which teach moral observance through tough endurance.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/23505.webp","source":"-","numberOfEpisode":"52","studio":"Tatsunoko Production","type":"TV","score":5.91,"genres":["Adventure","Fantasy"]},{"title":"Mirai Shounen Conan: Kyodaiki Gigant no Fukkatsu","synopsis":"Mirai Shounen Conan movie.","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/17369.webp","source":"Novel","numberOfEpisode":"1","studio":"Nippon Animation","type":"Movie","score":6.58,"genres":["Sci-Fi","Adventure","Drama"]},{"title":"Hoshi no Oujisama Petit Prince","synopsis":"The Little Prince lives on Asteroid B612, a tiny rock floating in space.

The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world`s entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack (`Bishounen-Killer`) Bancoran. Bancoran`s nickname doesn`t mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran`s eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour`s flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran`s palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang`s Metropolis, while Jack`s `apartment` bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst`s spread.) The action also goes into the past and future and out into space. Patarillo evidently gets around.\n\n(Source: aestheticism.com)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/56443.webp","source":"Manga","numberOfEpisode":"49","studio":"Toei Animation","type":"TV","score":7.33,"genres":["Adventure","Comedy","Romance","Shoujo","Shounen Ai"]},{"title":"Kaze wo Mita Shounen","synopsis":"Young boy Amon has mysterious powers.

One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade.\n\nA consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/13994.webp","source":"Manga","numberOfEpisode":"26","studio":"Madhouse","type":"TV","score":7.31,"genres":["Action","Adventure","Historical"]},{"title":"Fushigi Yuugi: Eikouden","synopsis":"Taka (technically Tamahome) and Miaka are now happily married and only six months before their new family would be born, but an obsessed girl named Mayo would do anything to make Taka hers.

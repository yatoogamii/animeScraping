The audience is expected to be enamored with this vehicle. At one scene when it looks like the tank is sure to get away, the background music turns into cocktail-lounge jazz and sparkly lights swirl around the tank. The tank carries six ATGM launchers (which Ken is somehow able to dislodge with minimal trouble, along with a piece of the turret, towards the end of the movie), three to each side of the turret, and a laser-based machine-gun-esque installment, in addition to its rifled main gun. The tank's treads are dual-mounted (the tread is split in half, making four sets of treads for the tank).\n\nThe employment of the laser, however, seems counter-productive to a machine-gun's mission, as it can only fire once every few seconds. If it can fire at higher rates, it does not do so, and tries to acquire a lock on its pursuer (Blader, in this case). This suggests a low ammunition capacity, unlike thousand-round-and-up machine-guns routinely mounted on modern tanks. It does not appear to have any effect on the road, either, which does not say much about its power.\n\nAnother tank involved is the MBT-90D, which are dispatched by the Army (or Air Force—the movie never makes it clear if it is a joint effort, although the general who arrives midway into the movie is shown riding in something resembling an ADATS) to take out the tank. Despite having at least a platoon of these, the MBT-99 still evades capture. The M-90Ds are armed with a three-barreled autocannon, the calibre of which may be around fifteen to twenty millimeters. The MBT-90D is equipped with three ATGM missile launchers, on the left side of the turret, and its main cannon is mounted on the front, instead of on a turret.\n\nAfter the MBT-99's hijackers (who appear inside the tank after getting away from a recently-committed bank robbery), hired by a shadowy group, backed by a foreign nation seeking an edge in their military (the M-99 is presumably on its way to be tested at a separate base), are forced out by Ken and his team, Eleanor enters to study the tank, and it starts up on its own, having been programmed by the hijackers to head for a pier and drive off its end so as to rendezvous with an enemy submarine. The rest of the movie is made up of the chase through the city, resulting in the destruction of another bank (owned by the same corporation that built the first bank in the movie), and various collateral damage.","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/67173.webp","source":"Original","numberOfEpisode":"1","studio":"Studio Nue","type":"Movie","score":5.49,"genres":["Action","Police","Mecha","Sci-Fi"]},{"title":"Haou Taikei Ryuu Knight: Adeu Legend","synopsis":"In an old world clash between light and darkness (as always), the evil Lord Uongadis is sealed away under a gigantic monument called the Earth Blade. 20 years have passed since the wars, and now the threat of evil being brought back is greater than ever as demons try to revive their lord.\n\n(Source: ANN)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/52143.webp","source":"-","numberOfEpisode":"13","studio":"Sunrise","type":"OVA","score":6.32,"genres":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy","Mecha"]},{"title":"Chou Kousoku Galvion","synopsis":"Super High Speed Galvion features mecha designs by Ohata Koichi (of Gunbuster fame).

Unlike the original International Rescue, which was small-scale and family-oriented, the IRO is a vast organisation comprising numerous branches and overseen by the Federation, the 2086 equivalent of the United Nations. No direct historical connections are identified between the two series, but it can be assumed that the original International Rescue evolved into its 2086 incarnation over those thirty years. The Tracy family are not mentioned in the animated series. In the animated series, the actual team is known as the Thunderbirds, whilst in the original series the name merely referred to their vehicles. The animated series is otherwise very similar to the original, with most episodes revolving around a natural or man-made disaster which the Thunderbirds team must investigate and help resolve. Unlike the original series, Thunderbirds 2086 also has an on-going story arc revolving around a breakaway independence group known as the Shadow Axis, led by the mysterious Star Crusher. There is a heavy intimation in the series that Star Crusher is not human and may be some kind of alien entity.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/7158.webp","source":"-","numberOfEpisode":"18","studio":"Toei Animation","type":"TV","score":6.11,"genres":["Action","Adventure","Mecha","Sci-Fi","Space"]},{"title":"Kigurumi Sentai Quiltian","synopsis":"Twin schoolgirls transform into their superhero aspects to save the world from an evil cabal of would-be dictators, but they can only fight for justice by having a lot of sex.\n\n(Source: ANN)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/62809.webp","source":"-","numberOfEpisode":"2","studio":null,"type":"OVA","score":5.41,"genres":["Hentai","Mecha"]},{"title":"Tetsujin 28-gou: Hakuchuu no Zangetsu","synopsis":"This theatrical version based on the manga by Yokoyama Mitsuteru, deals with the genius boy detective Kaneda Shotaro and his giant robot, Tetsujin 28, set in Tokyo ten years after the end of the Second World War.\n\nShotaro's missing brother appears as a a new character who was trained as a pilot of the soldier robot Tetsujin which Japan had created for the Second World War.

Stranger still is the presence of an enormous underground cavern below these symbols. At the bottom of the chasm, a portion of a tremendous tower juts from the ground.

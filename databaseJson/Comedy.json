All the dogs speak in the dialect of their individual prefectures. So for the Fukuoka dog you hear a lot of \"~to\" and \"~to yo\" at the end of sentences; for the Aichi dog it's \"~dagane,\" and for Ehime, \"~zonamoshi,\" etc.\n\n(Source: AsianBeat.com, edited)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/67133.webp","source":"-","numberOfEpisode":"26","studio":"Pollyanna Graphics","type":"TV","score":null,"genres":["Kids","Comedy"]},{"title":"Anoyo no Subete wa, Obake-gumi!","synopsis":"The gag anime takes place at a school for youkai and other supernatural beings.

He is an inventor, creating things that can aid him into doing his deed. If Gari-Gari buys the junkyard, this of course means that the three heroes will have no place to stay, so they constantly thwart his schemes. Gari-Gari has two henchmen working for him: Black and Nyu. Black is a gangster cat who welds a gun, often shooting at Punch and the gang with it.

An asphalt concrete highway runs through the area, used from time to time by various cargo trucks. Oscar is generally searching for food or water; he sometimes discovers liquid, in bottles or elsewhere, but is usually frustrated from recovering it for drink. An oasis supplies the only fresh water in the area, but its thick population of irascible and hungry crocodiles renders it inaccessible. At considerable personal risk (lizard is a delicacy for chickens), Oscar occasionally manages to steal an egg from a nearby hen coop, and he sometimes explores one of the piles of trash that litter the parched landscape. Popy, a fennec fox; Buck, a vulture; and Harchi, a hyena, inhabit a derelict school bus situated on a neighboring hill, but they mostly race about on a cast-off warehouse or grocery cart powered by Harchi and directed by Popy. Like Oscar, the trio constantly search for food and water - often competing with him, sometimes abusing him as a means, but occasionally cooperating with him when it suits their purpose. The main characters often find themselves falling off cliffs a la Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner, wherein the law of gravity is briefly suspended while the character comes to realize their imminent doom.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/80375.webp","source":"-","numberOfEpisode":"78","studio":"TUBA","type":"TV","score":5.87,"genres":["Comedy"]},{"title":"Bonobono","synopsis":"The first theatrical Bonobono movie.","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/22162.webp","source":"4-koma manga","numberOfEpisode":"1","studio":null,"type":"Movie","score":null,"genres":["Comedy"]},{"title":"Ketsuinu","synopsis":"Ketsuinu is a dog with a butt-like face.

This unusual but appealing cast of characters will charm viewers' hearts while it amuses them.\n\n(Source: Official Website)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/88117.webp","source":"-","numberOfEpisode":"56","studio":"Tatsunoko Production","type":"TV","score":6.45,"genres":["Action","Comedy","Kids","Magic","Mecha","Sci-Fi","Shounen","Super Power"]},{"title":"Neo Satomi Hakkenden: Satomi-chanchi no Hachi Danshi","synopsis":"An animated promotional video for the Neo Satomi Hakkenden: Satomi-chanchi no Hachi Danshi light novel series.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/37861.webp","source":"-","numberOfEpisode":"1","studio":null,"type":"ONA","score":5.41,"genres":["Comedy"]},{"title":"Ohayou Ninja-tai Gatchaman","synopsis":"One-minute flash shorts based on Tatsunoko Production's classic science-fiction hero series Science Ninja Team Gatchaman aired during the NTV's Zip! television program on mornings.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/75967.webp","source":"-","numberOfEpisode":"475","studio":null,"type":"TV","score":null,"genres":["Comedy","Parody"]},{"title":"The Snack World (TV)","synopsis":"In \"a certain era\" on \"a certain continent,\" banal things are happening.

The country was being torn apart by competing factions - modernizers trying to apply Western technology and ideas to Japanese society; Imperial loyalists, trying to reassert to the ascendancy of the Emperor; and the forces of the Shogunate, trying to defend the military bureaucracy (bakufu) against all comers. The bakufu organized special police squads, notably the Shinsengumi and the Mimawarigumi, to \"defend public order\" and assassinate opponents. (In popular culture, they are all lumped together as the Shinsengumi.) Covert violence and even open warfare were commonplace.\n\nThe movie covers 1866 and 1867. It tells the story of a retired samurai, Kumosuke (or Kumo, for short), who is living quietly, not to say idly, in Edo (old Tokyo) with his wife and two children, a young boy named Shinnosuke and an infant girl, Ohana. While he nominally runs a courier business to earn a living, he seems to spend most of his time smoking his pipe, drinking sake, and chasing women. The arrival of a Shinsengumi squad led by a young swordswman, Ichimonji Hyougo, disrupts this peaceful routine. Kumo is forced to use his still-sharp sword skills to defend himself, but he'd basically prefer to stay out of the treacherous political currents. Nonetheless, he ends up saving Ryouma Sakamoto (a famous Westernizer) from the Shinsengumi and teaching Ichimonji the futility of the warrior way.\n\n(Source: Soldado-Subs and Saizen)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1827/94766.webp","source":"Manga","numberOfEpisode":"1","studio":"Madhouse","type":"Movie","score":6.11,"genres":["Comedy","Historical","Samurai","Seinen"]},{"title":"Domo TV","synopsis":"A co-production between Nickelodeon and NHK featuring the stop-motion character Domo-kun, aired both in the US and Japan.","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/24339.webp","source":"Original","numberOfEpisode":"26","studio":"dwarf","type":"TV","score":6.35,"genres":["Comedy"]},{"title":"Lupin Shanshei","synopsis":"Series of 10 shorts parodying the popular classic anime Lupin III.","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/44261.webp","source":"-","numberOfEpisode":"10","studio":"TMS Entertainment","type":"OVA","score":5.62,"genres":["Parody","Comedy"]},{"title":"UFO Princess Valkyrie: Recap","synopsis":"A 45-minute recap episode of the first season, narrated by Sanada-san.","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/31897.webp","source":"Manga","numberOfEpisode":"1","studio":"TNK","type":"Special","score":6.26,"genres":["Comedy","Romance","Sci-Fi"]},{"title":"Happy ComeCome","synopsis":"Hiroshi is tired of living alone so he orders a maid robot from a company called Happy ComeCome, but ends up with the robot mom Yoshiko instead.

Out of gratitude, Sara became Dr. Chang's protege in the method of psychic feedback, the method which was used to cure her of her insecurities.\n\nHowever, Dr. Sara's method of therapy is vastly different than what Dr. Chang had used. By swinging her huge breasts in a circle, she is able to induce a hypnotic trance in her patients, after which she is able to learn what is bothering the patient and offer the proper solution. There is a risk of using this: Sara is often vulnerable to the sexual appetites of her patients and she must maintain control of the situation\n\nSara is not alone, though. She is often accompanied by Tamine, a man who cannot seem to get a woman, no matter how he tries. But Tamine is devoted to Sara (mostly because of her huge breasts, which he is able to cop a feel whenever the chance arises), and aids her in helping others in need.","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/66911.webp","source":"-","numberOfEpisode":"2","studio":"J.C.Staff","type":"OVA","score":5.5,"genres":["Comedy","Hentai","Yuri"]},{"title":"Minna Agechau♡","synopsis":"A beautiful day Rokurou, a student, was to masturbate when a beautiful girl knocks on his door: You need a virgin?

There's a little disclaimer at the front that says \"This is non-fiction, so I apologize for the lack of drama,\" and indeed, it mostly is just about them riding trains from place to place, waiting on platforms, etc. \n\nThe \"travel writer\" turns out to be a super train-otaku who has vast knowledge of the train network, but also micro-manages all their trips, planning every detail down to the second. He cares mostly about following the schedule and successfully achieving his planned goals (e.g. visiting all stations on a line in a completely bizarre order to accomodate infrequent trains). The mangaka doesn't really care about trains; she's cynical, sarcastic, and rather lazy (she mainly just looks forward to the next eki-ben); he's completely gung-ho as long as he's following the schedule, and the inevitable conflicts are pretty entertaining. \n\nThroughout, though, it feels real —if you've travelled by train in Japan it will all seem very familiar, not just the scenery, but also the atmosphere and feel— and the artist does a great job of pacing and applying little tweaks to keep it consistently entertaining. In an additional bit of recursiveness, some of the characters who show up in the manga (who of course are real people, who really did show up) do so because they (really) read previous episodes of the manga! \n\nIn addition of course, you can learn about various out of the way and interesting Japanese train lines and stations; some of them really do look cool. There's always this vague sense of surreality about it however, the trips are all planned by the train-guy (goal: visit all 9,843 stations in Japan) who seems to consider everything as part of a checklist rather than an experience to be enjoyed. You learn a bit about train-otaku culture too; there's really only the one guy in the story, but train-otaku culture is a sort of constant peripheral presence. \n\n(Source: AniDB) ","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/3270.webp","source":"Manga","numberOfEpisode":"13","studio":"Group TAC","type":"TV","score":6.37,"genres":["Comedy","Seinen","Slice of Life"]},{"title":"Blue Seed 1.5","synopsis":"This is a re-telling of the first series. one episode is seen through the view of Momiji, the other is seen through the view of Kusunagi.\n\n(Source: ANN)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/26709.webp","source":"-","numberOfEpisode":"2","studio":"Production I.G","type":"OVA","score":6.53,"genres":["Comedy","Romance","Sci-Fi"]},{"title":"Jigoku Sensei Nube (Movie)","synopsis":"Kumiko Ijima who is one of Nube's students recognizes that a man in a local park is really a criminal wanted for murder when she remembers drawing his face from the wanted photos posted by the police.

The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world`s entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack (`Bishounen-Killer`) Bancoran. Bancoran`s nickname doesn`t mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran`s eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour`s flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran`s palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang`s Metropolis, while Jack`s `apartment` bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst`s spread.) The action also goes into the past and future and out into space. Patarillo evidently gets around.\n\n(Source: aestheticism.com)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/56443.webp","source":"Manga","numberOfEpisode":"49","studio":"Toei Animation","type":"TV","score":7.33,"genres":["Adventure","Comedy","Romance","Shoujo","Shounen Ai"]},{"title":"Muhyo to Rouji no Mahouritsu Soudan Jimusho 2nd Season","synopsis":"Second season of Muhyo to Rouji no Mahouritsu Soudan Jimusho.","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1218/106376.webp","source":"Manga","numberOfEpisode":"?","studio":null,"type":"TV","score":null,"genres":["Action","Mystery","Comedy","Supernatural","Drama","Shounen"]},{"title":"Namakura Gatana","synopsis":"Namakura Gatana, meaning \"dull-edged sword,\" is a two-minute comedy about a samurai who, thanks to his dull instrument, loses every time he attacks a weak opponent.

Another mage, Fate Testarossa, is desperate to collect the seeds for some unknown and sinister purpose, though the solemn look in her eyes makes Nanoha think that there is more to Fate than meets the eye. Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 1st is a retelling of the original series, which tells the story of two young mages and how their strong emotions shape their actions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1058/94433.webp","source":"Original","numberOfEpisode":"1","studio":"Seven Arcs","type":"Movie","score":7.93,"genres":["Action","Sci-Fi","Comedy","Drama","Magic"]},{"title":"Onegai☆Twins: Natsu wa Owaranai","synopsis":"Two weeks have passed since the dilemma between Maiku, Karen and Miina was resolved, but their lives are more hectic than ever.

An ancient legend of Altomare is highly connected to the Eon Pokémon and the Soul Dew, and is well known among the locals—as well as among Latias' earlier assailants, the thief sisters Zanner and Lyon. As the thieves attempt to capture both the Eon Pokémon and the Soul Dew, Satoshi is forced to act in order to stop them from bringing disaster to Altomare.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/21317.webp","source":"Game","numberOfEpisode":"1","studio":"OLM","type":"Movie","score":7.23,"genres":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama","Fantasy","Kids"]},{"title":"Kamisama Hajimemashita OVA","synopsis":"Two OVA episodes bundled with the 16th volume of the manga.\n\nOne of the included episodes is based on the story from the 15th volume, while the other contain an all-new original story.\n\n(Source: ANN)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/56425.webp","source":"Manga","numberOfEpisode":"2","studio":"TMS Entertainment","type":"OVA","score":8,"genres":["Comedy","Demons","Supernatural","Romance","Fantasy","Shoujo"]},{"title":"Watashi, Nouryoku wa Heikinchi de tte Itta yo ne!","synopsis":"Having stood out from others most of her life due to her exceptional character, Misato Kurihara has lived without neither the joy of having close friends nor the experience of having a regular life.

In actuality, it turns out that this cosplaying cupid is the wielder of a Kiss Note, in which any pairing of names she writes will kiss and become a couple. Guri explains that she misspelt and accidentally wrote Seiji's name while indulging in her yaoi fantasies, but because she had yet to pair him with anyone, their kiss was meaningless. Even worse, Guri reveals that if Seiji is not coupled with anyone soon, not only will she die, but Seiji will remain a virgin for eternity!\n\nEager to escape his fate, Seiji sets his sights on the beautiful and popular Akane Hiyama. But after Akane hears that he kissed Guri, she reveals the obsessive and psychopathic feelings that she holds for the unfortunate boy and proceeds to viciously attack them.

Just when the situation could not get any more convoluted, this new coupling with Guri has turned Seiji and Akane into temporary angels, forcing them into assisting the cupid with her work of pairing humans, lest they be cast into hell.

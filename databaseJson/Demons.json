Full of kabuki makeup, songs about rape, murder, and satanic destruction, and a public persona of devilish evil. The OVA purports to tell the backstory of the band, which, according to its publicity, was composed of actual demons (akuma) from the parallel dimension Makai. In the OVA, five vicious demons (the five band members), led by Demon Kogure (the lead singer), are plotting the destruction of humanity. The only effective opposition comes from the saintly Rosa, who is actually the reformed war goddess Freyja in disguise. The demons attempt to activate their ultimate weapon, the Tower of Babel, before Rosa can complete her counter weapon, the Tower of Cain. The demons triumph and are on the verge on destroying the world when their leader suddenly decides that they should, instead, form a rock-and-roll band in order to convert people everywhere into demon worshipers.\n\n(Source: Orphan Fansubs)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/24158.webp","source":"Original","numberOfEpisode":"1","studio":"animate Film","type":"OVA","score":5.92,"genres":["Action","Demons","Supernatural","Fantasy"]},{"title":"Gegege no Kitarou: Kitarou no Yuurei Densha","synopsis":"Kitarou and the ghost train.","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/22651.webp","source":"-","numberOfEpisode":"1","studio":"Toei Animation","type":"Movie","score":5.95,"genres":["Adventure","Super Power","Demons","Supernatural"]},{"title":"The Gakuen Choujo-tai","synopsis":"Anime based on a 1986 novel.","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/34829.webp","source":"Novel","numberOfEpisode":"1","studio":"Magic Bus","type":"OVA","score":5.63,"genres":["Action","Demons","Shoujo","Super Power"]},{"title":"Youkai Watch Jam: Youkai Gakuen Y - N to no Souguu","synopsis":" ","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1276/104362.webp","source":"Game","numberOfEpisode":"?","studio":null,"type":"TV","score":null,"genres":["Comedy","Demons","Kids","Supernatural","School"]},{"title":"Battle Spirits: Saga Brave","synopsis":"(No synopsis yet.)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1275/102211.webp","source":"Card game","numberOfEpisode":"3","studio":null,"type":"ONA","score":null,"genres":["Game","Military","Sci-Fi","Adventure","Demons"]},{"title":"Tenjouhen: Utsunomiko","synopsis":"Prequel of Utsunomiko.","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/12812.webp","source":"Light novel","numberOfEpisode":"1","studio":"Toei Animation","type":"Movie","score":null,"genres":["Adventure","Demons","Fantasy"]},{"title":"Toukiden 2","synopsis":"Promotional anime for Koei-Tecmo game Toukiden 2 by Studio 4°C.","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/80662.webp","source":"Game","numberOfEpisode":"3","studio":"Studio 4°C","type":"ONA","score":5.64,"genres":["Action","Demons"]},{"title":"Kuroi Hitomi","synopsis":"Tabloid reporter Yexue witnessed a ghostly murder when the victims’ blood splashed into her right eye.

Dissatisfied with their slow advance into the Demon Realm, the Hero abandons his companions to quickly forge ahead towards the Demon Queen's castle. Upon his arrival at the royal abode, the Hero makes a startling discovery: not only is the Demon Queen a woman of unparalleled beauty, but she also seeks the Hero's help. Confused by this unexpected turn of events, the Hero refuses to ally himself with his enemy, claiming that the war the demons have waged is tearing the Southern Nations apart.\n\nHowever, the Demon Queen rebuts, arguing that the war has not only united humanity but has also brought them wealth and prosperity, providing evidence to support her claims. Furthermore, she explains that if the war were to end, the supplies sent by the Central Nations in aid to the Southern Nations would cease, leaving hundreds of thousands to starve. Fortunately, she offers the Hero a way to end the war while bringing hope not only to the Southern Nations, but also to the rest of the world, though she will need his assistance to make this a reality.\n\nFinally convinced, the Hero agrees to join his now former enemy in her quest. Vowing to stay together through sickness and health, they set off for the human world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/46041.webp","source":"Light novel","numberOfEpisode":"12","studio":"Arms","type":"TV","score":7.36,"genres":["Adventure","Demons","Romance","Fantasy"]},{"title":"Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis","synopsis":"Thousands of years ago, the ancient dragon Bahamut wrought havoc upon the land of Mistarcia, a world where both gods and demons live amongst mankind.

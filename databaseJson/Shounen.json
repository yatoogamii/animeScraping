The Symphonic Poem originated with the music Isao Tomita wrote for Jungle Emperor in 1965. He re-worked his music into a long form which tells a story by itself. (This form of music was termed \"symphonic poem\" or \"tone poem\" by composers in the late Romantic era.) So music that was written originally to enhance visual story telling became the story teller.\n\nTomita's symphonic poem was recorded in the mid-60s and issued on LP in Japan. More than once, in fact. It has also been on CD more than once.\n\nIn 1991, Tezuka Productions turned the process upside down and created new animation to illustrate the symphonic poem. The story is basically that of the first Kimba episode. We see the peaceful animal kingdom under Panja, the coming of the hunters, Eliza's capture and Panja's death. Kimba is born and escapes back to Africa. All this told without a single word spoken. The style of the Symphonic Poem's animation is unique. It draws heavily on the style of the 1989 TV series, but Kimba looks different from the way he looked in any other production.\n\n(Source: kimbawlion.com)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/36639.webp","source":"-","numberOfEpisode":"1","studio":"Madhouse","type":"OVA","score":6.5,"genres":["Adventure","Kids","Shounen"]},{"title":"Duel Masters Victory V","synopsis":"This series continues the adventures of Katta Kirifuda, Bucyake and Yohdel throughout the school season.

Naturally, there are constant quarrels in the family, and their quiet ordinary life seems to have been lost. \n\nAfter accidentally coming to know the family, Black Jack learns that the old woman had her young son, who was dying at the time, treated and saved by a noted doctor who claimed a great amount of money. She has, in fact, been paying for the treatment over some tens of years. Because of her great love for her son, the old woman devoted her entire life to paying for the treatment. \n\nNot aware of his mother's act, the son feels helplessly hammered and squeezed by his mother and his wife. But when he finally comes to know the truth, he is deeply impressed with the love of his mother, who valued her son's life more than her own. Black Jack asks him if he could love her just as much as she loved him. Explaining that only love valued more highly than life can live forever, the Phoenix then tells a story about the move of the capital to Heian, which was a great national project and an attempt to infuse a city with eternal life.\n\n(Source: official site)","img":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/27872.webp","source":"-","numberOfEpisode":"1","studio":null,"type":"Movie","score":6.53,"genres":["Shounen"]},{"title":"Cosmo Police Justy","synopsis":"In the future humanity is spread throughout the galaxy.
